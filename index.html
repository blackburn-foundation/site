  <p>Our family has always held education as a top priority. Thus, we formed
  The Blackburn Foundation to promote higher education and community development.
  Your support of the foundation is an investment in your community. To date we
  have supported scholarship programs, community development programs, teacher
  appreciation programs, and (students' favorite) the District 5 Academic Pep Rally.</p>

  <p>We encourage you to join us in our support of the community. This can be as
    simple as <a href="/donate">making a donation</a> or a bit more active in the
    form of <a href="/volunteer">volunteering</a>.
