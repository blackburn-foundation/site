On April 30, I presented to eighth graders at Harry Stone Montessori on the topic of "Get Out of Your Comfort Zone." This bit of advice has literally carried me around the world so I felt it was the best advice to give to the students as they move on to high school and college. We also discussed giving back to the community and, in keeping in line with this message, the Foundation raffled four $50 gift cards...with a catchâ€”the recipients had to spend at least half of the card on someone else. I drew this idea from a recent <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> talk entitled <em><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/michael_norton_how_to_buy_happiness.html">How to Buy Happiness</a></em> which basically says you buy happiness by giving the money away.

In addition to the gift cards, we gave away a single TI-84+ Silver Edition graphing calculator. By sheer coincidence the winner of the calculator was a student who had recently overcome struggles with a few concepts in math class that year. I was quite excited when I learned this after the presentation. Keep up the great work, Seth!
