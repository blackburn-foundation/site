We have received numerous donations in support of last week's academic pep rally; and, for these donations, I thank you all. We now have a new and exciting way for you to support our efforts via <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F&amp;tag=blackbfounda-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Amazon.com</a><img style="border: none !important;margin: 0px !important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=blackbfounda-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. Simply click the link and up to 10% of your purchase during your visit will be donated to the Blackburn Foundation. Don't worry: the cost of your purchase will not increase!

Remember, you'll have to use the link above every time you visit Amazon; so bookmark it.
