On <strong>November 11, 2011</strong>, Dallas ISD will participate in <strong><em>11.11.11</em></strong>, a literacy campaign conceived by Dr. Lew Blackburn, and initiated by the Dallas ISD Board of Trustees, designed to have every elementary student in the district spend <strong>11</strong> minutes reading a book or publication.  On that day, at <strong>11:11</strong> a.m., district staff and high school students will join a host of volunteers from the business community, service organizations and others to read with and to elementary students throughout the district.

<strong><em>11.11.11</em></strong> is part of <em>Dallas</em><em> Reads!</em>, a larger citywide initiative to encourage everyone to read.  Through <em>Dallas</em><em> Reads!</em> the district is joining forces with the City of Dallas, local organizations and businesses, and parents and community members to emphasize the power of literacy.

Encourage your colleagues, family and friends to volunteer for <strong>11-11-11</strong>, and to return as a volunteer on a regular basis.  Register now.  We’ll see you Friday, <strong>11-11-11</strong> at a school near you.  Students will be waiting for you.
