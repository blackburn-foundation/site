We've partnered with the City of Wilmer, Texas AD-HOC Committee to host the <strong>Let’s Do It Big, 
Back To School Rally!</strong> This epic rally will be held <strong>Saturday, August 19, 2017</strong> starting at 9 AM.
This will be a family-friendly event open to all residents of Wilmer, Texas.

We want to help all grade level students in Wilmer have what they need to succeed in school. Our aim is to supply each 
student with school supplies, backpacks, toiletries, snacks and hygiene products and much more. We also plan to serve 
awesome refreshments to the attendees. The overarching purpose for <strong>Let’s Do It Big, Back To School Rally
</strong> is to encourage every student with the knowledge that the whole Wilmer, Texas community is in full support of 
their education.
