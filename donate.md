When we at the Blackburn Foundation discuss donations, we do not consider donations to be <em>given</em>. The officers of the Blackburn Foundation consider every penny an <em>investment</em> in the futures of the communities and scholars affected by our programs and scholarships.

In addition to making a donation you can also support our efforts with every purchase you make on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F&amp;tag=blackbfounda-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Amazon.com</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=blackbfounda-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. Simply follow our link and up to 10% of the price of your purchase during that visit will be donated to the Blackburn Foundation. This will <em>not</em> increase the cost of any of your purchases. Don't forget to bookmark the link to ensure that every purchase you make supports our work in the community!
