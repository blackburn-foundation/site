When we at the Blackburn Foundation discuss donations, we do not consider donations to be <em>given</em>. The officers
of the Blackburn Foundation consider every penny an <em>investment</em> in the futures of the communities and scholars
affected by our programs and scholarships.

In addition to making a donation you can also support our efforts with every purchase you make on
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F&amp;tag=blackbfounda-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Amazon.com</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=blackbfounda-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" />.
Simply follow our link and up to 10% of the price of your purchase during that visit will be donated to the Blackburn
Foundation. This will <em>not</em> increase the cost of any of your purchases. Don't forget to bookmark the link to
ensure that every purchase you make supports our work in the community!

Donations can be made via credit card, ACH transfer, or PayPal using the form below.
