When we at the Blackburn Foundation discuss donations, we do not consider donations to be <em>given</em>. The officers 
of the Blackburn Foundation consider every penny an <em>investment</em> in the futures of the communities and scholars 
affected by our programs and scholarships.

In addition to making a donation you can also support our efforts with every purchase you make on 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F&amp;tag=blackbfounda-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Amazon.com</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=blackbfounda-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. 
Simply follow our link and up to 10% of the price of your purchase during that visit will be donated to the Blackburn 
Foundation. This will <em>not</em> increase the cost of any of your purchases. Don't forget to bookmark the link to 
ensure that every purchase you make supports our work in the community!

If you would like to pay via check, you cam mail your donation to:

<address>
The Blackburn Foundation<br>
3258 Telephone Road<br>
Dallas, Texas 75241<br>
</address>

Donations can also be made electronically via Dwolla or Paypal.
